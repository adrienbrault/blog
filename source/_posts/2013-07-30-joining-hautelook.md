I'm happy to announce that I will start an internship at [Hautelook][hautelook] in Los Angeles on august 12. :smiley:

The internship will lasts 12 months, and I will work along with [Baldur Rensch][baldur_gh] on their symfony2 backend,
api and probably all sort of other funny things.

So, the visa process has finally ended this morning, when I got my passport along with the J1 visa inside. It's a
relief, I've been stressed since the beginning of the process early june!

This opportunity came while working with [Baldur][baldur_gh] on the [FSCHateoasBundle][FSCHateoasBundle]. They use it at
Hautelook for their Hal API, so we've fixed bugs, added features etc :smiley:.
Anyway, I'm really glad open source lead me to such a great opportunity.

Anyway, I'm flying there tomorrow, I'm excited :smile:.
