My name is Adrien Brault, I am a software developer.

I started working with Symfony2 with the 4th beta on various school projects or during internships/jobs. I have since
become a [SensioLabs Certified Symfony Developer][certified], [contributed][github] to various open source projects, or
even [spoke at a conference][sflive_paris13].

I am also finishing my 4th year of studies at SUPINFO Paris.

I'm french (coucou!) and currently live near Paris, France.
